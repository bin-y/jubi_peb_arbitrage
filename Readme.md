# jubi_peb_arbitrage
A toy that is used for cny - peb - x three point arbitrage in jubi.com (won't work any more since both jubi and peb are gone)

I made this toy to help me have better understanding to the existing opensource coin arbitrage projects. It's also a practice to improve my javascript/nodejs skill.
